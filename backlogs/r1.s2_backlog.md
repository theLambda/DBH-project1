# Release 1, Sprint 2 ("r1.s2") Goal

## Development Environment Completion

The goal for this Sprint is to finish building and configuring the development environment.  To satisfy this goal, the project--with all of its technical dependencies and components--should work together so that the Team can have a productive development workflow.  Any future developer should be able to pull the code from the repository and start developing, knowing that the environment is configured properly.
