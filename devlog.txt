AWS EC2 server set up:
Git clone project on to local machine
Verify django project can run on local machine
Start EC2 instance with the HTTP port 80 exception
download the keypair and put into project directory
connect to instance from CLI
set up the server once connected:
sudo apt update
sudo apt upgrade
sudo apt install python3-pip python3-dev libpq-dev postgresql postgresql-contrib nginx gunicorn curl

Clone repo using HTTP request with personal token instead of password:
git clone
activate virtual environment
install requirements

% python3 manage.py makemigrations
% python3 manage.py migrate
% python3 manage.py collectstatic

current roadblock is actually running the server,
getting psyco2pg errors and unable to download into the server
